# DB-BERT Mod

## Introduction

This project is an attempt to reimplement and modernize some core aspects of DB-BERT, a powerful tool for database tuning that extracts configuration hints from textual documents using natural language processing and optimizes database settings with reinforcement learning. Given that the original implementation of DB-BERT was created some time ago, many dependencies and system requirements had become outdated, making it challenging to set up and use the tool in modern environments.

To address these issues, this project introduces significant updates, including the adoption of a Docker-based setup. The new Docker configuration ensures that all dependencies and software versions are updated to the latest standards, providing a seamless and hassle-free environment for building and running DB-BERT. Users can now get started with minimal effort, avoiding the complexities of manual installations and version conflicts.

Additionally, certain core modules have been reimplemented as part of this project. This reimplementation serves not only to improve compatibility but also as a means to better understand the underlying algorithms and methodologies used in DB-BERT. These efforts aim to preserve the essence of DB-BERT while enhancing its usability, maintainability, and relevance in contemporary systems.

## What is DB-BERT?
DB-BERT extracts hints for database parameter settings from text via natural language analysis. It then optimizes parameter settings for a given workload and performance metric using reinforcement learning.

## Running Experiments

To simplify the setup process, DB-BERT now uses Docker to encapsulate its environment. Follow these steps to set up and run DB-BERT experiments:

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Docker**
- Ensure Docker is installed on your system. You can download and install Docker from [Dockerâ€™s official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

2. **Clone the Repository**
- Clone the DB-BERT repository:
  ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/JoelJacobStephen/DB-Bert-Mod
     cd dbbert
  ```

### Setup with Docker

1. **Build the Docker Image**
- From the `dbbert` directory, build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t dbbert:latest .
     ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**
- Start a Docker container using the built image:
     ```bash
     docker run -it --rm -p 8501:8501 dbbert:latest
     ```
- This will start the Streamlit GUI and expose it on port `8501`. Access it by navigating to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

3. **Interactive Shell (Optional)**
- To access an interactive shell inside the container for custom experiments, use:
     ```bash
     docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash dbbert:latest
     ```

### Running Experiments

- Once inside the container, you can run DB-BERT experiments using the CLI. Example:
  ```bash
  PYTHONPATH=src python3 src/run/run_dbbert.py demo_docs/postgres100 64000000000 200000000000 8 pg tpch dbbert dbbert "sudo systemctl restart postgresql" /tmp/tpchdata/queries.sql --recover_cmd="sudo rm /var/lib/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.auto.conf"
  ```

- During execution, DB-BERT generates two result files:
  - **dbbert_results_performance**: Contains performance measurements.
  - **dbbert_results_configure**: Describes configurations used for each trial run.

### Notes

1. The PostgreSQL and MySQL databases are pre-configured with a user named `dbbert` and password `dbbert`.
2. Benchmark databases (e.g., TPC-H and JOB) are installed during the Docker build process.

## Using DB-BERT: GUI

- You can:
  - Select settings to read from configuration files in the `demo_configs` folder.
  - Select a collection of tuning text documents for extraction (e.g., from the `demo_docs` folder).
  - Change parameters related to database access, learning, and tuning goals.
  - Click the **Start Tuning** button to start the tuning process.
