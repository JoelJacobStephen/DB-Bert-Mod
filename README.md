# DB-BERT: the Tuning Tool that "Reads" the Manual

DB-BERT extracts hints for database parameter settings from text via natural language analysis. It then optimizes parameter settings for a given workload and performance metric using reinforcement learning.

Here is the updated README file with instructions for setting up and running DB-BERT using Docker:

DB-BERT: the Tuning Tool that “Reads” the Manual

DB-BERT extracts hints for database parameter settings from text via natural language analysis. It then optimizes parameter settings for a given workload and performance metric using reinforcement learning.

Running Experiments

To simplify the setup process, DB-BERT now uses Docker to encapsulate its environment. Follow these steps to set up and run DB-BERT experiments:

Prerequisites

	1.	Install Docker
	•	Ensure Docker is installed on your system. You can download and install Docker from Docker’s official website.
	2.	Clone the Repository
	•	Clone the DB-BERT repository:

git clone https://github.com/JoelJacobStephen/DB-Bert-Mod
cd dbbert



Setup with Docker

	1.	Build the Docker Image
	•	From the dbbert directory, build the Docker image:

docker build -t dbbert:latest .


	2.	Run the Docker Container
	•	Start a Docker container using the built image:

docker run -it --rm -p 8501:8501 dbbert:latest


	•	This will start the Streamlit GUI and expose it on port 8501. Access it by navigating to http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

	3.	Interactive Shell (Optional)
	•	To access an interactive shell inside the container for custom experiments, use:

docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash dbbert:latest



Running Experiments

Once inside the container, you can run DB-BERT experiments. Example:

PYTHONPATH=src python3 src/run/run_dbbert.py demo_docs/postgres100 64000000000 200000000000 8 pg tpch dbbert dbbert "sudo systemctl restart postgresql" /tmp/tpchdata/queries.sql --recover_cmd="sudo rm /var/lib/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.auto.conf"

During execution, DB-BERT generates two result files:
	•	dbbert_results_performance: Contains performance measurements.
	•	dbbert_results_configure: Describes configurations used for each trial run.

Notes

	•	The PostgreSQL and MySQL databases are pre-configured with a user named dbbert and password dbbert.
	•	Benchmark databases (e.g., TPC-H and JOB) are installed during the Docker build process.

# Using DB-BERT: GUI

- To start the GUI, run `streamlit run src/run/interface.py` from the DB-BERT root directory.
- If accessing DB-BERT on a remote EC2 server, make sure to enable inbound traffic to port 8501.
- Enter the URL shown in the console into your Web browser to access the interface.
- You can select settings to read from configuration files in the `demo_configs` folder.
- Select a collection of tuning text documents for extraction (e.g., from the `demo_docs` folder).
- You may change parameter related to database access, learning, and tuning goals.
- Click on the `Start Tuning` button to start the tuning process.

# Using DB-BERT: CLI

Use DB-BERT from the command line using `src/run/run_dbbert.py`.

## Required Parameters

The module requires setting the following parameters:

| Parameter        | Explanation                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| memory           | the amount of main memory of the target platform, measured in bytes.                                                                                          |
| disk             | the amount of disk space on the target platform, measured in bytes.                                                                                           |

| dbms             | whether to tune PostgreSQL (set to `pg`) or MySQL (set to `ms`).                                                                                              |
| db_name          | name of database on which target workload is running.                                                                                                         |
| db_user          | name of database login with access to target database.                                                                                                        |
| db_pwd           | password of database login.                                                                                                                                   |
| restart_cmd      | command for restarting database server from command line. E.g., `"sudo systemctl restart postgresql"` or `"sudo systemctl restart mysql"`.                    |
| query_path       | path to .sql file containing queries of target workload, separated by semicolon (no semicolon after the last query!).                                         |

Note: specifying `recover_cmd` parameter is optional but highly recommended (otherwise, sub-optimal parameter settings may prevent a restart of the database server, preventing DB-BERT from correcting faulty parameter values).

## Optional Parameters

You may also want to set the following parameters:

| Parameter           | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| hint_order          | try out tuning hints in document order (set to `0`), parameter order (set to `1`), or optimized order (set to `2`, recommended).                                             |
| nr_frames           | maximal number of frames to execute for learning (recommendation: set high, e.g. `100000`, to rely on timeout instead).                                                      |
| timeout_s           | maximal number of seconds used for tuning (this number is approximate since system finishes trial runs before checking for timeouts).                                        |
| performance_scaling | scale rewards due to performance improvements by this factor.                                                                                                                |

| min_batch_size      | batch size used for text analysis (e.g., `8`, optimal settings depend on language model).                                                                                    |
